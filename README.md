Microsoft-Buildings-Code-Sample
===============================

An App for Office for Outlook with a Compose Form that calls a JSON service to get a list of Buildings to inject into body of email.

This was originally demonstrated by Rolando Jimenez Salgado at the SharePoint Conference 2014 in the Office Power Hour session http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/SharePoint-Conference/2014/SPC351.
